Service Testing
===============

In this module, we run our three interacting services using Docker. Then
we try to write service test against running services. Then we write a
better test using mb as service virtualizer.

Start
-----

  * `cd ~/topics/start/02-service-testing`
  * Bring up all services: `docker-compose up`

Excersice
---------
  * Write a passing contract test against running apps
  * Simiulate breaking change on the app
  * See the failing contract tests
